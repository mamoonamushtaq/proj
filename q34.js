We are drawn to foods that are fatty, sweet, rich and complex.
I like pizza as it has all of these components. 
Cheese is fatty, meat toppings tend to be rich and the sauce is sweet. 
And to add to that we get glutamate, which is found in the tomatoes, cheese, pepperoni and sausage.
I really love pizza!
